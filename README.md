## 🏆 Learning Progression

1.  Start in the `beginner/` folder. Read the code, run the server, and understand the flow.
2.  Once comfortable, try to add a new route and controller in the beginner version.
3.  Move to the `production/` folder. Notice how we handle the same concepts but with more structure and safety.
4.  Use the `production/` template to build your real-world applications.
